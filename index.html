      Not all animal shelters are the same. Fortunate homeless and unwanted animals end up in the hundreds of open admission animal shelters that are staffed by professional, caring people.
      At these facilities, frightened animals are reassured, sick and injured animals receive treatment or a peaceful end to their suffering, and the animals living quarters are kept clean and dry. Workers at these facilities never turn away needy animals and give careful consideration to each animals special emotional and physical
      To be able to offer refuge to every animal in need, open admission shelters must euthanize unadopted and unadoptable animals. The alternative turning them away is cruel and leaves the animals in grave danger.
      Many less fortunate lost or abandoned animals end up in pitiful shelters that are nothing more than shacks without walls or other protection from the elements, where animals are often left to die from exposure, disease, or fights with other animals.
      At Ray's animal shelter we give you an opportunity to play a crucial role in rescuing an animal that is in need
      of a safe home and a loving family. Our animals are given necessary vaccinations, which is compulsary before or
      after adoptions. They are also given monly checkups by our most trusted vetenarians.
      we will help you find wht you are missing. A pet you can call family.</p>
